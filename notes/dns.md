DNS hostnames and DNS resolution are required settings for private hosted zones. DNS queries for private hosted zones can be resolved by the Amazon-provided VPC DNS server only. As a result, these options must be enabled for your private hosted zone to work.

1. **DNS hostnames** : For non-default virtual private clouds that aren't created using the Amazon VPC wizard, this option is disabled by default. If you create a private hosted zone for a domain and create records in the zone without enabling DNS hostnames, private hosted zones aren't enabled. To use a private hosted zone, this option must be enabled.

2. **DNS resolution** : Private hosted zones accept DNS queries only from a VPC DNS server. The IP address of the VPC DNS server is the reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus two. Enabling DNS resolution allows you to use the VPC DNS server as a Resolver for performing DNS resolution. Keep this option disabled if you're using a custom DNS server in the DHCP Options set, and you're not using a private hosted zone.
