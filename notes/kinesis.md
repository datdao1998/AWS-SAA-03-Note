## General Concept
You can use Kinesis Data Analytics to transform and analyze streaming data in real-time with Apache Flink. Kinesis Data Analytics enables you to quickly build end-to-end stream processing applications for log analytics, clickstream analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), ad tech, gaming, etc. The four most common use cases are streaming extract-transform-load (ETL), continuous metric generation, responsive real-time analytics, and interactive querying of data streams. Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink applications provides your application 50 GB of running application storage per Kinesis Processing Unit (KPU).

## Enhanced Fanout Features
By default, the 2MB/second/shard output is shared between all of the applications consuming data from the stream. You should use enhanced fan-out if you have multiple consumers retrieving data from a stream in parallel. With enhanced fan-out developers can register stream consumers to use enhanced fan-out and receive their own 2MB/second pipe of read throughput per shard, and this throughput automatically scales with the number of shards in a stream.
