## 1. Concept
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. AWS KMS is a secure and resilient service that uses hardware security modules that have been validated under FIPS 140-2.

AWS KMS supports multi-region keys, which are AWS KMS keys in different AWS regions that can be used interchangeably â€“ as though you had the same key in multiple regions. Each set of related multi-region keys has the same key material and key ID, so you can encrypt data in one AWS region and decrypt it in a different AWS region without re-encrypting or making a cross-region call to AWS KMS.

## 2. Customer Master Key
Deleting a customer master key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is destructive and potentially dangerous. Therefore, AWS KMS enforces a waiting period. To delete a CMK in AWS KMS you schedule key deletion. You can set the waiting period from a minimum of 7 days up to a maximum of 30 days. The default waiting period is 30 days. During the waiting period, the CMK status and key state is Pending deletion. To recover the CMK, you can cancel key deletion before the waiting period ends. After the waiting period ends you cannot cancel key deletion, and AWS KMS deletes the CMK

## 3. Key Management Service
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a service that combines secure, highly available hardware and software to provide a key management system scaled for the cloud. When you use server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), you can specify a customer-managed CMK that you have already created. SSE-KMS provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom.
