### 1. Blue/Green Deployment
Blue/green deployment is a technique for releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application: "Blue" is the currently running version and "green" the new version. This type of deployment allows you to test features in the green environment without impacting the currently running version of your application. When youâ€™re satisfied that the green version is working properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic from the old blue environment to the new green environment. Blue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with deploying software, such as downtime and rollback capability.

### 2. Request Routing and IP Addresses
If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface for the instance. The load balancer rewrites the destination IP address from the data packet before forwarding it to the target instance.

If you specify targets using IP addresses, you can route traffic to an instance using any private IP address from one or more network interfaces. This enables multiple applications on an instance to use the same port. Note that each network interface can have its security group. The load balancer rewrites the destination IP address before forwarding it to the target.
