## 1. Amazon Cognito Identity Pools
The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services. To enable users in your user pool to access AWS resources, you can configure an identity pool to exchange user pool tokens for AWS credentials.

-> **Identity Pools aren't an authentication mechanism in themselves**

## 2. Amazon Cognito User Pools
A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. You can leverage Amazon Cognito User Pools to either provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Amazon. Whether your users sign-in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).
