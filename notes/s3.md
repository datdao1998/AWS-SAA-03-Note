## 1. Access Control List
Within Amazon S3, you can use ACLs to give read or write access on buckets or objects to groups of users. With ACLs, you can only grant other AWS accounts (not specific users) access to your Amazon S3 resources

## 2. Versioning
Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. Versioning can only be suspended once it has been enabled.

## 3. S3 owner
By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it. This is true even when the bucket is owned by another account. Because the Amazon Redshift data files from the UNLOAD command were put into your bucket by another account, you (the bucket owner) don't have default permission to access those files.

## Standard-IA Storage
The Standardâ€“IA storage class reduces storage costs for files that are not accessed every day. It does this without sacrificing the high availability, high durability, elasticity, and POSIX file system access that Amazon EFS provides. AWS recommends Standard-IA storage if you need your full dataset to be readily accessible and want to automatically save on storage costs for files that are less frequently accessed.
