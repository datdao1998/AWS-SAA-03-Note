### Note 1
The ALB operates at the HTTP and HTTPS level only (does not support TCP load balancing).

### Note 2
The Network Load Balancer operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets â€“ Amazon EC2 instances, containers and IP addresses based on IP protocol data. It is architected to handle millions of requests/sec, sudden volatile traffic patterns and provides extremely low latencies.

The NLB provides high throughput and extremely low latencies and is designed to handle traffic as it grows and can load balance millions of requests/second. NLB also supports load balancing to multiple ports on an instance.
