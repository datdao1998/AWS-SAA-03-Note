Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed Microsoft Windows file servers, backed by a fully native Windows file system. Multi-AZ file systems provide high availability and failover support across multiple Availability Zones by provisioning and maintaining a standby file server in a separate Availability Zone within an AWS Region.

Amazon FSx works with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to integrate with your existing Microsoft Windows environments. Active Directory is the Microsoft directory service used to store information about objects on the network and make this information easy for administrators and users to find and use.
