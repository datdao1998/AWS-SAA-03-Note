## Concept
**Amazon Redshift** is a fully-managed petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse product designed for large scale data set storage and analysis.

## Amazon Redshift Spectrum
Using Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can efficiently query and retrieve structured and semistructured data from files in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into Amazon Redshift tables.

Amazon Redshift Spectrum resides on dedicated Amazon Redshift servers that are independent of your cluster. Redshift Spectrum pushes many compute-intensive tasks, such as predicate filtering and aggregation, down to the Redshift Spectrum layer. Thus, Redshift Spectrum queries use much less of your cluster's processing capacity than other queries.
