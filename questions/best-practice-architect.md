**Question**

A startup wants to create a highly available architecture for its multi-tier application. Currently, the startup manages a single Amazon EC2 instance along with a single Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The startup has hired you as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate to build a solution that meets these requirements while minimizing the underlying infrastructure maintenance effort.
What will you recommend?

**A. Create an Auto-Scaling group with a desired capacity of a total of two Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones. Configure an Application Load Balancer having a target group of these Amazon EC2 instances. Set up Amazon RDS MySQL DB in a multi-AZ configuration**

B. Create an Auto-Scaling group with a desired capacity of a total of two Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones. Configure an Application Load Balancer having a target group of these Amazon EC2 instances. Set up a read replica of the Amazon RDS MySQL DB in another Availability Zone

C. Create an Auto-Scaling group with a desired capacity of a total of two Amazon EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone. Configure an Application Load Balancer having a target group of these Amazon EC2 instances. Set up Amazon RDS MySQL DB in a multi-AZ configuration

D. Provision a second Amazon EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. Provision a second Amazon RDS MySQL DB in another Availabililty Zone. Leverage Amazon Route 53 for equal distribution of incoming traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances. Use a custom script to sync data across the two MySQL DBs

**Explained**

In a multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous “standby” replica in a different Availability Zone. Updates to your DB Instance are synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to the standby to keep both in sync and protect your latest database updates against DB instance failure.
