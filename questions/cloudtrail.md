**Question**

A company has moved its suite of internal tools to AWS. For audit compliance, several CloudTrail trails are made to record all API calls. Each log file is also protected with server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed encryption keys (SSE-KMS). Despite this, the company wants to ensure it can identify whether a log file has been tampered with.

Which security measure should the solutions architect employ?

**A. Enable the CloudTrail Log File Validation feature on all trails.**

B. Use the CloudTrail Processing Library when doing audit compliance.

C. Enable CloudTrail Insights events.

D. Configure CloudWatch Logs to monitor all trails and use Amazon SNS to send notifications when a log file has been tampered with.
