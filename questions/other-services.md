**Question**

A company has a fixed set of Amazon EC2 instances inside a VPC in the AWS cloud. The instances run a mission-critical application. In a recent incident, one of the EC2 instances suddenly powered down which affected the availability of the application. To avoid this incident in the future, the management wants to get notified of any upcoming AWS events that may affect these EC2 instances.

**Question**

A company has migrated its containerized workloads into the AWS Cloud. The microservices applications are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances with Docker installed, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and newer deployments are hosted on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The company is using open-source tools such as Prometheus and Grafana installed on a virtual machine in its data center for monitoring its applications. The management wants to use the same tools for monitoring its containerized applications in its cloud environment.

Which of the following options is the recommended implementation for this scenario?

A. Export the on-premises VM and upload the image to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use VM Import/Export to import the image and launch it as an Amazon EC2 instance. Reconfigure Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the containerized cloud workloads.

**B. Create a workspace on AWS Manage Service for Prometheus to collect container metrics. Set this workspace as the data source in AWS Managed Grafana for monitoring and data visualization.**

C. Create a new Amazon ECS cluster. Deploy the Prometheus and Grafana containers on this cluster for monitoring containerized workloads. Configure Prometheus for container metrics collection and Grafana for monitoring and data visualization.

D. Create a new workspace AWS Managed Grafana to collect container metrics. Associate this as a data source in Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. Configure data queries on Prometheus to visualize, monitor, and create alerts for the containerized workloads.

**Question**

A FinTech company has been running its compute workload on the AWS Cloud. In order to quickly release the application, the developers have deployed several Amazon EC2 instances, Auto Scaling groups and AWS Lambda functions for the different components of the application stack.
