A company needs to accelerate the performance of its AI-powered medical diagnostic application by running its machine learning workloads on the edge of telecommunication carriersâ€™ 5G networks. The application must be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster and have role-based access control (RBAC) access to IAM users and roles for cluster authentication.

Which of the following should the Solutions Architect implement to ensure single-digit millisecond latency for the application?

**A. Launch the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Create node groups in Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster via the AWS Wavelength service. Apply the AWS authenticator configuration map (aws-auth ConfigMap) to your cluster.**

B. Host the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Set up node groups in AWS Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster. Attach the Amazon EKS connector agent role (AmazonECSConnectorAgentRole) to your cluster and use AWS Control Tower for RBAC access.

C. Host the application to an Amazon EKS cluster and run the Kubernetes pods on AWS Fargate. Create node groups in AWS Wavelength Zones for the Amazon EKS cluster. Add the EKS pod execution IAM role (AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole) to your cluster and ensure that the Fargate profile has the same IAM role as your Amazon EC2 node groups.

D. Launch the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Create VPC endpoints for the AWS Wavelength Zones and apply them to the Amazon EKS cluster. Install the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes (aws-iam-authenticator) to your cluster.
