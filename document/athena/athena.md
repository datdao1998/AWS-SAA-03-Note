**Amazon Athena** is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. 

Amazon Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage, and customers pay only for the queries they run. You can use Athena to process logs, perform ad-hoc analysis, and run interactive queries.
