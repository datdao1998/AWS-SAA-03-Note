# Concept and usecases
**EventBridge** is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for you to build scalable event-driven applications. Event-driven architecture is a style of building loosely-coupled software systems that work together by emitting and responding to events. Event-driven architecture can help you boost agility and build reliable, scalable applications.

**Use Case**
* Route events from sources such as home-grown applications, AWS services, and third-party software to consumer applications across your organization. 
* Provides simple and consistent ways to ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events so you can build applications quickly
