## Best Practice
1. AWS Lambda functions always operate from an AWS-owned VPC. By default, your function has the full ability to make network requests to any public internet address â€” this includes access to any of the public AWS APIs.

2. Since AWS Lambda functions can scale extremely quickly, this means you should have controls in place to notify you when you have a spike in concurrency. A good idea is to deploy an Amazon CloudWatch Alarm that notifies your team when function metrics such as ***ConcurrentExecutions*** or ***Invocations exceeds your threshold***. You should create an AWS Budget so you can monitor costs on a daily basis.

3. AWS Lambda allocates compute power in proportion to the memory you allocate to your function. This means you can over-provision memory to run your functions faster and potentially reduce your costs. 

    However, AWS recommends that you should not over provision your function time out settings. Always understand your code performance and set a function time out accordingly. Overprovisioning function timeout often results in Lambda functions running longer than expected and unexpected costs.
