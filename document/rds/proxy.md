**RDS Proxy** helps you manage a large number of connections from Lambda to an RDS database by establishing a warm connection pool to the database. Your Lambda functions interact with RDS Proxy instead of your database instance. It handles the connection pooling necessary for scaling many simultaneous connections created by concurrent Lambda functions. This allows your Lambda applications to reuse existing connections, rather than creating new connections for every function invocation.
