**Blue/green deployment** is a technique for releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application:
 * "Blue" is the currently running version 
 * "Green" is the new version. 
 
 This type of deployment allows you to test features in the green environment without impacting the currently running version of your application. 
 
 When youâ€™re satisfied that the green version is working properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic from the old blue environment to the new green environment. 
 
 Blue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with deploying software, such as downtime and rollback capability.
