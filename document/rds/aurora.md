## Aurora DB
You can quickly create clones of an Aurora DB by using the database cloning feature. 

In addition, database cloning uses a copy-on-write protocol, in which data is copied only at the time the data changes, either on the source database or the clone database. 

Cloning is much faster than a manual snapshot of the DB cluster.
