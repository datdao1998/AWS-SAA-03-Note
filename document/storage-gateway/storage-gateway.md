# Storage Gateway vs DataSync

**AWS Storage Gateway** is a set of hybrid cloud services that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Customers use Storage Gateway to integrate AWS Cloud storage with existing on-site workloads so they can simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases. These include moving backups to the cloud, using on-premises file shares backed by cloud storage, and providing low latency access to data in AWS for on-premises applications.

**AWS DataSync** is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services. You can use DataSync to migrate active datasets to AWS, archive data to free up on-premises storage capacity, replicate data to AWS for business continuity, or transfer data to the cloud for analysis and processing.

=> Both AWS Storage Gateway and AWS DataSync can send data from your on-premises data center to AWS and vice versa. 

> AWS Storage Gateway is more suitable to be used in integrating your storage services by replicating your data

> AWS DataSync is better for workloads that require you to move or migrate your data.
