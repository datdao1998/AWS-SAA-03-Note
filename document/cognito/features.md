# Features
## User pools
An Amazon Cognito user pool is a user directory. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito, or federate through a third-party IdP. Federated and local users have a user profile in your user pool.

## Identity pools
An identity pool is a collection of unique identifiers, or identities, that you assign to your users or guests and authorize to receive temporary AWS credentials.

**Identity Pools aren't an authentication mechanism in themselves**
