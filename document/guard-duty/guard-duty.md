**Amazon GuardDuty** continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help protect your AWS resources, including your AWS accounts and access keys.

Amazon GuardDuty identifies any unusual or unauthorized activity, like cryptocurrency mining or infrastructure deployments in a region that has never been used. Powered by threat intelligence and machine learning, GuardDuty is continuously evolving to help you protect your AWS environment.

Amazon GuardDuty can generate findings based on suspicious activities such as requests coming from known malicious IP addresses, changing of bucket policies/ACLs to expose an S3 bucket publicly, or suspicious API call patterns that attempt to discover misconfigured bucket permissions.
