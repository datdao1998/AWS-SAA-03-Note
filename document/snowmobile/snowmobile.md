**AWS Snowmobile** is an Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS. 
* You can transfer up to 100PB per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck. 
* Snowmobile makes it easy to move massive volumes of data to the cloud, including video libraries, image repositories, or even a complete data center migration. 
* Transferring data with Snowmobile is more secure, fast, and cost-effective. 
* AWS recommends using Snowmobile to migrate large datasets of 10PB or more in a single location. 
* For datasets less than 10PB or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball.
