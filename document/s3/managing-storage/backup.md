**AWS Backup** is a fully managed, policy-based service that you can use to centrally define backup policies to protect your data in Amazon S3

When using AWS Backup for Amazon S3, you can perform the following actions:
* Create continuous backups and periodic backups. Continuous backups are useful for point-in-time restore, and periodic backups are useful to meet your long-term data-retention needs.
* Automate backup scheduling and retention by centrally configuring backup policies.
* Restore backups of Amazon S3 data to a point in time that you specify.
