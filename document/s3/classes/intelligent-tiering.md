**S3 Intelligent-Tiering** storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier when access patterns change, without operational overhead or impact on performance. For a small monthly object monitoring and automation charge, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and automatically moves objects that have not been accessed to lower-cost access tiers.
