The storage classes are purpose-built for data archiving, and are designed to provide you with the highest performance, the most retrieval flexibility, and the lowest cost archive storage in the cloud. You can choose from three archive storage classes optimized for different access patterns and storage duration.
* **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**: For archive data that needs immediate access, such as medical images, news media assets, or genomics data -> An archive storage class that delivers the lowest cost storage with milliseconds retrieval
* **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: For archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use cases, with retrieval in minutes or free bulk retrievals in 5—12 hours.
* **S3 Glacier Deep Archiv**: To save even more on long-lived archive storage such as compliance archives and digital media preservation, the lowest cost storage in the cloud with data retrieval from 12—48 hours.
