**Service control policies (SCPs)** are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s access control guidelines

An SCP restricts permissions for IAM users and roles in member accounts, including the member account's root user. Any account has only those permissions permitted by every parent above it. If a permission is blocked at any level above the account, either implicitly (by not being included in an Allow policy statement) or explicitly (by being included in a Deny policy statement), a user or role in the affected account can't use that permission, even if the account administrator attaches the AdministratorAccess IAM policy with / permissions to the user.

SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account. They affect only the member accounts in your organization
