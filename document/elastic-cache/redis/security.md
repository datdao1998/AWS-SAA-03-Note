## Mitigating failures
**Multi-AZ** is the best option when data retention, minimal downtime, and application performance are a priority.
* Data-loss potential - Low. Multi-AZ provides fault tolerance for every scenario, including hardware-related issues.
* Performance impact - Low. Of the available options, Multi-AZ provides the fastest time to recovery, because there is no manual procedure to follow after the process is implemented.
* Cost - Low to high. Multi-AZ is the lowest-cost option. Use Multi-AZ when you can't risk losing data because of hardware failure or you can't afford the downtime required by other options in your response to an outage.
