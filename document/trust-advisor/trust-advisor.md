**AWS Trusted Advisor** is an online tool that draws upon best practices learned from AWSâ€™s aggregated operational history of serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers.

**AWS Trusted Advisor** inspects your AWS environment and makes recommendations for saving money, improving system performance, or closing security gaps. 

It scans your AWS infrastructure and compares it to AWS Best practices in five categories (Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, Service limits) and then provides recommendations.
