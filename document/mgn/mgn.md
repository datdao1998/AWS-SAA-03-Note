**AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)** is the primary migration service recommended for lift-and-shift migrations to AWS. AWS encourages customers who are currently using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery to switch to AWS MGN for future migrations. AWS MGN enables organizations to move applications to AWS without having to make any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers.

**AWS Application Migration Service** minimizes time-intensive, error-prone manual processes by automatically converting your source servers from physical, virtual machines, and cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS.
