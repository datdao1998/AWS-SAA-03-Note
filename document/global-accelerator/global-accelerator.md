## What is AWS Global Accelerator ?
**AWS Global Accelerator** is a networking service that helps you improve the availability and performance of the applications that you offer to your global users.
 
AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure, and manage. 

It provides static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry point to your applications and eliminate the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones.

## How it works
Global Accelerator terminates TCP connections from clients at AWS edge locations and, almost concurrently, establishes a new TCP connection with your endpoints. This gives clients faster response times (lower latency) and increased throughput.
