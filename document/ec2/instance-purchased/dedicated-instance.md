**Dedicated Instances** are EC2 instances that run on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer
* Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single payer account. 
* However, Dedicated Instances might share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.
