* A **launch configuration** is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances.

* You can only specify one launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group at a time, and you can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it.
