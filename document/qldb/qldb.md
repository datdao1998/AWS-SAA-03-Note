Amazon QLDB can be used to track every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.

With Amazon QLDB, you can trust that the history of changes to your application data is accurate. QLDB uses an immutable transactional log, known as a journal, for data storage. The journal tracks every change to your committed data and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.
