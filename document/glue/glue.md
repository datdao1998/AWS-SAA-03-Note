## Concept
**AWS Glue** is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources. You can use it for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It also includes additional productivity and data ops tooling for authoring, running jobs, and implementing business workflows.

* With AWS Glue, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog. You can visually create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes. 
* Also, you can immediately search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

## How it works
* AWS Glue uses other AWS services to orchestrate your ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs to build data warehouses and data lakes and generate output streams. 

* AWS Glue calls API operations to transform your data, create runtime logs, store your job logic, and create notifications to help you monitor your job runs. 

* The AWS Glue console connects these services into a managed application, so you can focus on creating and monitoring your ETL work. The console performs administrative and job development operations on your behalf. You supply credentials and other properties to AWS Glue to access your data sources and write to your data targets.
