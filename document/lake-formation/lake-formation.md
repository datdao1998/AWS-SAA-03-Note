**AWS Lake Formation** is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions.

## Integrate with S3
Amazon S3 forms the storage layer for Lake Formation. If you already use S3, you typically begin by registering existing S3 buckets that contain your data. Lake Formation creates new buckets for the data lake and import data into them. AWS always stores this data in your account, and only you have direct access to it.
